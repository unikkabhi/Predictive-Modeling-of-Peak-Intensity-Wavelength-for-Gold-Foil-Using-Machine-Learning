# Predictive-Modeling-of-Peak-Intensity-Wavelength-for-Gold-Foil-Using-Machine-Learning
This project involves developing a machine learning model to predict the wavelength corresponding to the peak intensity of gold foil based on its diameter. The dataset used includes measurements of gold foil diameters and their associated peak intensity wavelengths, created and preprocessed using MATLAB.
